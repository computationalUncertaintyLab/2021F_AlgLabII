1) Write a function to determine if a given number is even or odd.
2) Write a function that generates the first 100 Fibonacci numbers and plot the result (i on the x-axis and Fibonacci on the y-axis).
3) Write a function that prints "heads" if a coin flip returns 1 and prints "tails" if it returns 0. 
4) Write a function that computes the Bernoulli likelihood of 10 coin flips and plot it as a function of p (or theta).
