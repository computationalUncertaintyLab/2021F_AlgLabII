    "### A matrix/vector solution to the mean and to the standard deviation\n",
    " 1.  Use the function `rnorm` to draw 50 samples from a Normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2.\n",
    " 2.  Create your own function called `mymean` that computes the mean of a vector using matrix algebra. Your function should not involve the sum function. (A useful function will be the [ones](https://rdrr.io/cran/optimbase/man/ones.html) function)\n",
    " 3.  Create your own function called `mystd` that computed the standard deviation of a vector using matrix algebra. Your function should not involve the sum function or squaring (i.e. ^2).\n",
    " 4. Write a for loop that does the following 1,000 times: draws 500 samples from a Bernoulli distribution with probability equal to 0.2, computes the mean of this sample, and stores that empricial mean in a vector called `samplemeans`.\n",
    " 5. Use the `hist` function to draw a histogram of `samplemeans`. What distribution does this look like?"
